     <h1><u>In WPL UP Warriorz win by 7 wickets </u></h1>  <!--heading and underline-->
        <p>BENGALURU: WPL 2024, MI vs UPW highlights, Mumbai Indians vs UP Warriorz: Fresh  from a five-wicket win over Gujarat Giants in their 
          previous fixture, Mumbai Indians were without skipper Harmanpreet Kaur against the UP Warriorz in match No. 6 of the action-packed 
          Women's Premier League (WPL) 2024 on Wednesday. Winless in their first two games, the struggling Warriorz side 
          bounced back by defeating the defending champions by 7 wickets at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.

        <p>Opener Hayley Matthews scored a gritty half-century while crucial knocks from Yastika Bhatia (26) and 
          Amelia Kerr (23) lifted Mumbai Indians to 161-6 in 20 overs. In reply, Alyssa Healy (33) and Kiran Navgire (57) 
          added 94 runs for the first wicket to put UP in the driving seat. Grace Harris (38*) and Deepti Sharma (27*) remained 
          unbeaten to seal UP Warriorz's seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians.
        </p>

        <p>UP Warriorz lost a thriller to Royal Challengers Bangalore Women by just 2 runs in their WPL 2024 
          opener at the same venue last week. UP Warriorz were then crushed by Delhi Capitals (DC) in matchday 4 of the 
          elite T20 tournament. After recording back-to-back defeats in the league phase, the UP Warriorz are expected to 
          make changes to their lineup against Mumbai Indians. Superstar Chamari Athapaththu can make her presence felt for the  
          first time at the WPL. Skipper Alyssa Healy asserted that her side should be smart with the decision-making. Warriorz 
          are just above bottom-placed Gujarat Giants on the WPL points table.
        </p>

        <p>Reigning champions Mumbai Indians retained the second spot in the WPL 2024 standings. RCB is the only unbeaten 
          side in the 2024 edition of the T20 tournament. Earlier, skipper Harmanpreet and Amelia Kerr's half-century 
          partnership powered Mumbai to a comfortable win over Gujarat Giants in Bengaluru on Sunday. Harmanpreet remained 
          unbeaten on 46 while Amelia scored 31 as Mumbai extended their winning run to two games. Skipper Harmanpreet smoked 
          a massive six to wrap up the contest in 18.1 overs. Mumbai missed the services of Harmanpreet as the 2023 winners recorded 
          their first defeat of the season to UP Warriorz.
