	      astronauts--all IAF fighter pilots--for India's ambitious maiden human spaceflight mission

	    </p>

	    <p>: Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Angad Prathap, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan and 
	       Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, for Indian Space Research Organisation's (Isro) Gaganyaan's mission .

        <p>All four, short-listed four years ago,</p>

        
        <P>Congratulating all the astronauts-elect, PM Modi said their names will be etched as part of the 21st
           century and commended them for training rigorously for the past four years. He said yoga will also play 
           an important role in their training as it will help keep a healthy body and mind, which is crucial.
        </P>

        <p>Isro chairman S Somanath said: "Three important projects are being dedicated to the nation which have
           been completed on time. These mark significant additions to Isro infrastructure. We’ve seen tremendous
           progress made by Isro with the kind of missions, especially, Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 which made the
           world turn back to look at India. The 2047 vision made public has ambitious projects to make India Viksit
           Bharat and Isro will work towards achieving this."
        </p>

        <p>In July 2019, TOI first reported that all astronaut-elects for Gaganyaan would be test pilots given 
           that it was India’s first human spaceflight mission and by virtue of their specialisations, test pilots
           have always been called upon to study deeply all that can probably go wrong in something that has not been tried before.
        </p>

        <p>While a large number of test pilots had enrolled to become astronauts, 12 of them made it past the first 
           level of selection completed in Sept 2019 in Bengaluru. The selection was done at the Institute of Aerospace 
           Medicine (IAM), an institute under the Indian Air Force (IAF).
        </p>

        <p> After multiple rounds of selection, the IAM and Isro then shortlisted the final four. By early 2020, 
          Isro sent the four test pilots to Russia for initial training, which after some delay induced by Covid-19, was completed in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>Since then, the four have been undergoing various training modules in India. Isro has tied up with multiple agencies, 
          including from the armed forces for the same. Isro has also been working on equipping its Human Space Flight Centre 
          (HSFC) with various simulators for the training. They are also continuing with their regular flying with IAF to remain fit, 
          while other fitness regimes are also part of their routine.
        </p>

        <p>“I request the citizens and specifically the media to cooperate in the future. The astronauts-elect have continuously 
           done penance for the past four years. They have done this without making themselves visible. They still have a long way 
           to go, there are many challenges. But now, they’ve become celebrities, I know people will want autographs and selfies and the 
           media would also want to know everything about their lives. But this could be detrimental to their achievements. The real story is beginning 
           now. We need to cooperate with them and their families so they can focus on enabling the ambitious goal,” PM Modi said. 
        </p>
