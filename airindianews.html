    	<p>Following a report carried in the TOI on February 16, the regulator had issued a show cause notice 
    	  to the airline for not complying with the provisions of the "CAR SECTION 3, SERIES 'M', PART I on 'Carriage 
          by Air - Persons with Disability (Divyangjan) and/or Persons with Reduced Mobility' which is a violation of Aircraft Rules, 1937." 
        </p>
    	<p>Air India submitted its  response to the notice on February 20.</p>

    	<p>The airline informed that the elderly passenger wished to walk along with his wife who was on a wheelchair too, 
    	  rather than wait for another wheelchair.
    	</p> 

    	<p>"However, the airline failed to show compliance of the CAR as the airline did not provide any wheelchair to the 
    	   elderly passenger. Further, Air India did not inform about any action taken by the airline against the erring employee(s) 
           and the airline also failed to submit any corrective actions taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future,
           " said the DGCA in a press statement. "Accordingly, a financial penalty of Rs 30 lakh has been imposed on Air India as per  
           Aircraft Rules, 1937 for violating the provisions of the aforementioned CAR," it added. 
       </p>
    	
    	<p>An advisory has also been issued to all airlines to ensure that an adequate number of wheelchairs are available for  
    	   passengers who require assistance during embarking or disembarking from the aircraft during their journey.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>On February 12, the 80-year old US citizen of Indian origin, along with his wife had flown to Mumbai from 
    	   New York on an Air India flight. Both had booked for the wheelchair facility, but because of a shortage of wheelchairs, 
    	   only one was brought for the couple. The senior citizen was asked to wait for another wheelchair. But opted to walk alongside 
           his wife who used the wheelchair. He walked the long distance to the terminal collapsed and passed away at the airport immigration counter.
        </p>

    	<p>On February 20, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognizance of the passenger's death. 
    	  The NHRC issued a notice to the DGCA seeking a report in four weeksâ€™ time.
